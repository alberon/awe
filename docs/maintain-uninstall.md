## Uninstalling Awe

To remove Awe from your machine, simply uninstall it with npm:

```bash
$ sudo npm uninstall -g awe
```

This will also delete the Node.js and Ruby dependencies that were downloaded automatically during installation (e.g. CoffeeScript, Sass, Compass). It will not remove any project files (configuration, cache files or compiled assets).

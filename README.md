# Awe

Awe is a tool used at [Alberon](http://www.alberon.co.uk) to handling the compilation of assets. It makes it easy to compile CoffeeScript & Sass files, autoprefix CSS files and combine source files together, with full source map support for easier debugging.

**Note:** It is no longer recommended as [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is much more flexible and more widely supported.

While it is not designed to be used by third parties, it is open source and you're welcome to use it if you want to!

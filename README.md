# Awe

Awe simplifies the building and maintenance of websites / web apps, by handling the compilation of **assets** - it makes it easy to compile CoffeeScript & Sass files, autoprefix CSS files and combine source files together, with full source map support for easier debugging.

In the future it will also handle **deployment** to remote live/staging servers, and related functionality such as **configuration management**.
